## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy jupyter
```

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd E:\Pandas\Project1
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Open `retail_store.ipynb`**

## 📈 Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection
- Load the retail store dataset
- Examine data structure, shape, and basic statistics
- Identify data types and missing values

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Handle missing postal codes using mode imputation
- **Duplicate Detection**: Check and remove duplicate records
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data quality and consistency

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Temporal Features**: Extract month and year from order dates
- **Date Formatting**: Convert order dates to proper datetime format
- **Month Names**: Transform numeric months to readable month names

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Product Performance**: Analyze top-selling products
- **Regional Analysis**: Compare sales across different regions
- **Category Analysis**: Evaluate performance by product categories
- **Temporal Trends**: Examine monthly and yearly sales patterns

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

### Sales Performance
- ✅ **Top 10 Products by Sales**: Identify best-performing products
- ✅ **Regional Sales Distribution**: Compare performance across regions
- ✅ **Category Performance**: Analyze sales by product categories
- ✅ **Monthly Revenue Trends**: Track seasonal patterns by year

### Data Quality Improvements
- ✅ **Missing Value Imputation**: 41 missing postal codes filled with mode
- ✅ **Duplicate Detection**: Verified no duplicate records exist
- ✅ **Feature Enhancement**: Added Order Month and Order Year columns

## 📋 Key Findings

- **Data Quality**: Successfully cleaned dataset with 0% missing values after preprocessing
- **Temporal Analysis**: Created meaningful time-based features for trend analysis
- **Sales Distribution**: Comprehensive breakdown by multiple dimensions (product, region, category, time)
