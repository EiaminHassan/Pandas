# 📊 Pandas Learning and Practice Notebooks

Welcome to my Pandas learning repository!  
This repo is dedicated to building a strong foundation in **Pandas**, the powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation.

I’m learning from scratch and documenting my journey through hands-on **Jupyter Notebooks** with beginner to advanced exercises.

## 📁 Projects

### Project1 - Retail Store Data Analysis

Located in the `Project1/` folder, this project focuses on analyzing a retail store dataset to uncover selling trends and patterns. Using **NumPy** and **Pandas**, I'll explore:

- Sales performance across different products and time periods
- Customer purchasing behavior and trends
- Product popularity and seasonal variations
- Data visualization to identify key insights

This hands-on project demonstrates practical application of data manipulation and analysis techniques learned throughout the repository.
